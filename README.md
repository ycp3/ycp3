# Who am I?
My name is Jasper St. Pierre. I'm a fourth year student at the University of Waterloo in the Faculty of Mathematics (Combinatorics and Optimization).
I'm currently on a co-op term at [Harled Inc.](https://harled.ca/) as Full Stack Developer leveraging primarily Ruby on Rails ðŸ˜„
I love meeting new people so please don't hesitate to talk to me or reach out!

# User guide
- Being around people keeps me energized, especially in person, but I do my best work when focused and alone. If I get too distracted during the day I'll finish up work at home in the evening.
- I like to mentally map problems out and plan solutions in my head before putting it into code. I'll often forget to verbalise what I'm doing so if you're working with me and you're not sure what I'm doing, please ask!
- I enjoy when people challenge how I solved something, because when I think I have a good solution I tend to overlook even better solutions.
- I can do the most with clear, specific, and actionable feedback and criticism.
- Long meetings are super draining for me, so I'd appreciate it if I can get a "cooldown period" of around 10 mins before returning to work.
- Overall, I'm super flexible and can adapt to most circumstances, given proper notice!

# I'm interested in...
- New AI/ML applications are always emerging and I'm super excited to see what's next!
- Learning new technologies in general
- Video games (FFXVI, NieR)
- Piano / Guitar
- Anime (Mob Psycho, A Place Further than the Universe)

# I'm currently learning...

- Rust + bevy
- Ricing Arch Linux
